Upgrading PMD at Runtime

   The Maven PMD plugin comes with a default PMD version: for <<<maven-pmd-plugin ${project.version}>>>,
   <<PMD  ${pmdVersion}>> is used by default.

   Given that the {{{https://pmd.github.io}newer PMD version}} is compatible,
   you can override the PMD version, that the Maven plugin will use and benefit
   from the latest bugfixes and enhancements:

<project>
  <properties>
    <pmdVersion>...choose your version...</version>
  </properties>
...
  <build>
    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-pmd-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${project.version}</version>
